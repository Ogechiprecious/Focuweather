// Building a weather app using a free wether Api called accuweather api which allows us to query their api endpoints for weather inflamation which is how we are able to display the weather forecast.
// Using methods of asynchronous, await , dom query and other things that have been learnt so far to build this.

// the app.js is going to contain the dom query and other selectors
// the forecast.js is for interacting with the weather api's in getting data.
